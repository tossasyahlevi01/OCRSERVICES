wrapMode.SetWrapMode(WrapMode.TileFlipXY) prevents ghosting around the image borders -- na√Øve resizing will sample transparent pixels beyond the image boundaries, but by mirroring the image we can get a better sample (this setting is very noticeable)
destImage.SetResolution maintains DPI regardless of physical size -- may increase quality when reducing image dimensions or when printing
Compositing controls how pixels are blended with the background -- might not be needed since we're only drawing one thing.
graphics.CompositingMode determines whether pixels from a source image overwrite or are combined with background pixels. SourceCopy specifies that when a color is rendered, it overwrites the background color.
graphics.CompositingQuality determines the rendering quality level of layered images.
graphics.InterpolationMode determines how intermediate values between two endpoints are calculated
graphics.SmoothingMode specifies whether lines, curves, and the edges of filled areas use smoothing (also called antialiasing) -- probably only works on vectors
graphics.PixelOffsetMode affects rendering quality when drawing the new image
